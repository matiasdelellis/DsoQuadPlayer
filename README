DsoQuadPlayer:
University project for Técnicas Digitales I, UTN - FRBA.

The project consists in using oscilloscope DSO 203 [1], to record samples on analog channels, and play these in wave out channel.

FPGA side: ICE65LO4F
 * Record samples on analog channels.
 * Store samples on the FPGA implementing a FIFO memory.
 * When required send samples to the STM32 micro using the bus FSMC.
 * Maybe implement some digital filter..

NOTE: The control of recording, save memory, erase memory, etc. will be done using the PIO pins that are free.

STM32 side: STM32F103V
 * This is a VHDL project therefore will be used high-level language to interact with the screen and play the samples obtained with the BUS.  Particularly QuadPawn [2], which has an Pawn interpreter for use on this device.
